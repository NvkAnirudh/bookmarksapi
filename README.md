# Bookmarks-API

The project you've described is a backend system that manages bookmarks and tracks the number of visits made by users to those bookmarks. It has been implemented using a RESTful API architecture and Python Flask framework.

The purpose of the system is to provide users with a centralized platform to store and organize their bookmarks. Each user has their own account, which allows them to create, modify, and delete bookmarks according to their preferences. The backend handles the storage and retrieval of bookmark data, ensuring that each user's bookmarks are kept separate and secure.

The RESTful API design enables users to interact with the system through standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Users can access their bookmarks, add new bookmarks, update existing bookmarks, and delete unwanted bookmarks by making API requests to specific endpoints provided by the backend.

In addition to bookmark management, the backend also tracks the number of visits each user makes to their bookmarks. This functionality allows users to monitor their own usage patterns and determine which bookmarks are most frequently accessed. The backend maintains a count of visits for each bookmark and increments it whenever a user accesses a bookmark through the provided API.

The Python Flask framework serves as the foundation for developing this backend system. Flask is a lightweight and flexible framework that facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs. It provides the necessary tools and utilities to handle incoming API requests, manage database interactions, and perform the required operations on the bookmark data.

Overall, this project provides users with a convenient and efficient way to store and manage their bookmarks while offering insights into their usage patterns through visit tracking. The combination of RESTful API architecture and Python Flask framework ensures a robust and scalable solution for bookmark management and visit tracking.
